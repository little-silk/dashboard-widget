# Dashboard Widgets

## What Is This?
The concept of a Dashboard appears nearly everywhere. Most obvious are car dashboards with displays of speed, mileage, and navigation. Less obvious examples are: the FaceBook banner with notifications, informational displays in lobbies, and “widgets” on iOS and Android. A portion of a larger display is a widget.

## Why Does This Exist?
* Application of Dashboard Design concepts
* APIs allows for alternative User Interfaces for same information
* Real products and real data, versus static prototypes
* Dashboards convey information in real-time — without prompting
* Apply concepts from Web Design 1 and 2 with APIs from Web 3
